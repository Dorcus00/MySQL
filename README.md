# SQL
Welcome to the SQL Repository! This project contains a collection of SQL scripts and queries. 
Dived into Maji Ndogo's expansive database containing 60,000 records spread across various tables using basic queries to familiarise ourselves with the content of each table. Along the way,refining some data using DML.
Harnessed the power of a wide range of functions, including intricate window functions, to tease out insights from the data tables.
Pulled data from many different tables and applied some statistical analyses to examine the consequences of an audit report that cross-references a random sample of records.
Finalised my data analysis using the full suite of SQL tools. I gained final insights, used them to classify water sources, and prepare relevant data(Progress report table) for our engineering teams.
